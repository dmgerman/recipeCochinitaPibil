Cochinita Pibil
====================

This recipe is my fork of Modernist Cousine at Home recipe for Carnitas.

First of all, i don't call it carnitas because the recipe is really Cochinita Pibil (a mayan famous recipe)

This would be one of my recipes if I had to open a restaurant (as Robert Rodriguez recommends selecting)

- 1 kg pork shoulder cut into cubes of 2-3cm per side
- 15 g of achiote paste
- 2.5 chipotle powder (but any flavourful chile powder would do)


First step:

- Make a stock with the bone (that is another recipe...)

Second step:

- Combine pork and stock in the pressure cooker. 
- Cook at 15 PSI for 30 minutes (you should time it when it reaches pressure).

the meat should now separate with a fork. If not, redo for few minutes more.

Third step;

- Remove meat from the pot
- add achiote and chile powder
- Reduce at low heat until it becomes thick
- Add meat back

This is amazing in tacos. 

In the full tradition of cochinita pibil slice onion add lime and habanero (or jalape~no)
Serve together
